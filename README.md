This project aims at applying concepts including: 
* EDA on multi-category store dataset
* clustering
* hyper-personalisation
* Amalgamating multi-category store dataset with mall customer dataset
* Hyperparameter optimization
* Creating latent manifold suitable for the above dataset 
* Applying a bunch of ML algorithms to see what works best with different usecases
* Experimenting with different data distributions to see how it affects the performance of ML algorithms
* concepts of CLV and RFM
